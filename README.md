# Linear-Regression-with-Sklearn-library
This process aimed to be able describe a linear regression of this Data Set, so performe predictive analysis about the sales price, considering the car features. 

# Data Set
This fictional database is about a used car store. For a list of vehicles we have features that influence their price.
The existing fields are: make, body, mileage, engine volume and its type, year and model.

# Process
Using descriptive statistics it was possible verify the quality of the data presents in this data set, dealing with missing values, outliers and determining the interest variables, those who directly influence the final price of sale

# Libraries
To prepare the analysis performed it was used the following libraries:
Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodel, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn

# Statistics Concepts
In this case was used the Linear Regression model, and validate considering the Ordinary Least Squares assumptions: Linearity, No endodenicity, Normality and homocedasticity, No autocoorelation and No multicollinearity. 
Using sklearn library, the data set was splited between Tr
